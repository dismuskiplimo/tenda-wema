## About the Project
tendawema.com is a social group where members earn Simba Coins for doing good deeds that positively impact their own local communities. Members can then use the Simba Coins (virtual social currency) earned to buy items donated by members to the Community instead of money. Members advance social levels and maintain their social status in the Community by accumulating Simba Coins earned for performing even more good deeds. <br>


## [Live Demo - Heroku](https://tenda-wema.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

* PHP
* Laravel
* MySQL Server (any supported RDBMS can be used)

## Prerequisites
- PHP 7.1 or later (best if also added to the env path for direct access with the terminal)
- MySQL Server, PsotgreSQL, or any other RDBMS supported by Laravel
- Composer
- Text Editor - Visual Studio Code recommended
- MPESA Daraja API credentials (https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/)

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dismuskiplimo/tenda-wema.git
    ```

* Navigate to panaqia folder/directory

    ```shell
    cd panaqia
    ```
* Rename `.env.example` to become `.env`
    ```shell
    mv .env.example .env
    ```
* Open the `.env` file using your favourite text editor. This file contains necessary configuration data for the application to run
* You need only to edit the `DB` section e.g `DB_DATABASE`,`DB_USERNAME`,`DB_PASSWORD`, for the initial installation. Ensure that the database selected is already created in your REBMS server (mysql, postgresql, sqlite e.t.c) or the installation will fail.

## Installation

After the `.env` configuration file has been updated, resume to the terminal and type in the following commands

1. Install all the dependencies.
   ```shell
    composer install
   ```
2. Generate the application keys
    ```shell
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
3. Create the tables and migrate them to your DB
    ```shell
    php artisan migrate
    ```
4. Populate the database with necessary system configuration
    ```shell
    php artisan db:seed
    ```
    Yaay, you're done üëç
    
5. Now, Launch the development server.
   ```shell
   php artisan serve
   ```
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the website
7. Once you verify that the website is working, re-open the `.env` file to finish defining the remaining configurations
