				<h4>OUR STORY</h4> 

				<p>
					Just over a year ago, we became fascinated by the idea of creating value from less used items that lie idle in boxes, cupboards, wardrobes, drawers, attics, garages and basements in homes and offices. What if you could derive value from a computer laptop or an academic text book that another person was not using anymore? Or help someone else derive value from your sports shoes or scooter bike you do not use anymore? The possibilities are endless and the impact of value co-creation immense.

				</p>

				<p>
					We then embarked on creating a platform that would enable individuals give their idle items to others who need them and likewise get items they need given by others. In essence creating value from previously inherent idle items and facilitating exchange without consideration. Our innovation as a result of the creative process to actualize this idea is {{ config('app.name') }}: The Simba Coin Community of good deeds. Tim Maber Limited is principally a transformative social enterprise creating a socio-economic community that care, give and do good.
				</p>

				<p>
					These five core values embody our culture, spirit and dedication to doing whatâ€™s right. They keep us aligned to our vision and define our actions including donations we accept and partners we engage with.
				</p>

				<ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px">

				<ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 20px">
					<li>
						<i>To inspire a culture of doing good:</i> No matter how big or small, good deeds carry a double punch, people make a positive impact and they feel great at the same time. 
					</li>

						<i>To provide a source of essential items:</i> People can obtain many of the things they need using Simba Coins giving them purchasing power not dependent on availability of money. 
					</li>
